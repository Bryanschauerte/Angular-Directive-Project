# Angular-Directive-Project

Directives range from very basic to extremely complex. This project will build up to some somewhat difficult directives. Keep in mind that the format we're learning for directives is the same format used to build some extremely complex things in angular. Using directives often and well is one way to show you're a talented developer.

## Starting Out
We've included only a few things for you to begin with. `index.html`, `app.js`, `styles.css`. At this point the best way to get more comfortable with angular is to initialize an app without relying heavily on boilerplate code (reusable code that starts out your projects for you).

###Routes
You'll notice that in the `index.html` we've included the angular-route CDN. Yes, we'll be using angular's router here. Put an `ng-view` into your `index.html`. Then in your `app.js` set up a `config` and set up our first route for when a user is at the `'/home'` url. If you're having trouble remembering how to set up the router go look at how you set up the router on the previous project. One way these projects will be beneficial to you is allowing you to look back at something **you** did and seeing how **you** got that something to work.
